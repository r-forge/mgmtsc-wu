The ART of dependence modelling: 
The latest advances in correlation analysis

Abstract:

Both at the design stage as well as at the pricing stage of Alternative
Risk Transfer (ART) products, the notion of low (zero) beta plays an
important role. By now it is well known that for these non-standard
products, the interpretation of dependence through linear correlation,
and hence the portfolio beta language becomes dubious. We review some of 
the new tools like copulas to handle the measurement of dependence in ART 
products. An example will be discussed.
